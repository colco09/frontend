              My partner trained as an architect, and now he is cursed. His
              curse is not just working like an architect works, with grueling
              hours and implacable clients, although that’s true. His curse is
              seeing like an architect sees. Every structure is, to him, a
              palimpsest of the structure that could have been, if the people
              who built things—other architects, of course, and also
              building-code writers and contractors and construction workers and
              landscapers and interior designers—had made different choices. If
              they had made better choices. Sometimes, the “what-if” structure
              is only a minor variation on the structure that actually exists:
              If the cabinet maker were more expert, for instance, the custom
              wine rack would have fitted perfectly. Other times, the “what-if”
              structure is more consequential: If better insulation had been
              installed, then some Texans might not have frozen to death in
              their homes during this year’s winter storm. Much of the built
              environment in American cities, if you stop and look at it, really
              look, is ugly. Even worse—it’s hostile to humans doing basic human
              things, like walking, or breathing. Not being able to ignore that
              ugliness and hostility, not being able to unsee how structures
              could be different, is the architect’s curse.
